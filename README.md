# Welcome to Jeff's Airdrop Token Sender!

This project is to learn how to build a fullstack web application that uses an ERC20 smart contract to use a token contract address and airdrop the token to multiple recipients.

A 100% client-side UI for the TSender contract.

# Getting Started

## Requirements

- [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
    - You'll know you've installed it right if you can run `node --version` and get a response like `v23.0.1`
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
    - You'll know you've installed it right if you can run `pnpm --version` and get a response like `10.1.0`
- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
    - You'll know you've installed it right if you can run `git --version` and get a response like `git version 2.33.0`

### Environment Variables

You'll need a `.env.local` the following environment variables:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID`: Project ID from [reown cloud](https://cloud.reown.com/)

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/matcherbudz/TSender-airdrop-ui-cu
cd TSender-airdrop-ui-cu
pnpm install
pnpm anvil
```

You'll want to make sure you have a Metamask/Rabby wallet connected to your anvil instance. Ideally you're connected to the wallet that comes with the default anvil instance. This will have some mock tokens in it.

Then, in a second terminal run:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

# Testing

## Unit

```bash
pnpm test:unit
```

## e2e

Playwright should also install the browsers needed to run tests.

To test e2e, do the following

```bash
pnpm cache
```

Then run:

```bash
pnpm test:e2e
```

This will throw an error like:

```
Error: Cache for 08a20e3c7fc77e6ae298 does not exist. Create it first!
```

The `08a20e3c7fc77e6ae298` is your `CACHE_NAME`

In your `.cache-synpress` folder, rename the folder that isn't `metamask-chrome-***` to your `CACHE_NAME`.

Then, you should be able to run:

```
pnpm test:e2e
```

Then hit the play button and the playwright tests should work
